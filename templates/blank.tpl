		<span style="font-size: 175%; line-height: normal;" id="newestVersion">Live Ticket Update XIV</span>
		<br><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">Bug Fixes</span>
		<br>1. Fixed a bug that was causing tickets that you reassigned to be shown in the side area as if you created them.
		<br>2. Fixed a long standing bug that was not filtering some of the show all areas by the logged in user
		<br>3. Fixed a bug with the start page not showing tickets if they were old and got a new response since your last visit.
		<br>4. Fixed the bug from <a class="ticket_link ticket_button ticket_sprite" href="ticket/434">ticket 434</a>.
		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">New Features</span>
		<br>1. New start page.
		<br>1.1 Tickets that have been worked on since your last visit are now shown instead of the update notes.  Update notes are still accessable though the link in the top right corner.
		<br>1.2 Ticket lists have been reworked along side the crusade to banish the table tag.
		<br>2. Tickets is using the rounded corner CSS from the theme generator now. This will insure that the corners look correct.
		<br>3. New look to tickets and replies.  More table tags squashed!
		<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">Known Issues</span>
		<br>1. Large Graphs are still not working properly
		<br>2. Some themes do not work 100%
		<br>3. There are no page numbers, nor any way to show more then the default amount of tickets in the list view.

		<br>1. Tickets is now working in Opera, as well as versions of Firefox prior to 3.1.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">New Features</span>
		<br>1. Ticket types are now in.  They are <span class="bug ticket_sprite ticket_button">bug tickets</span> and <span class="error ticket_sprite ticket_button">trouble tickets</span>.
		<br><blockquote>be sure to choose the proper type of ticket.  Bug reports should be fixed for web code and things that can be fixed, but probably not related to computers.  While trouble tickets are for everything that is not a bug.</blockquote>	
		<br>2. Recent tickets should now be working properly.
