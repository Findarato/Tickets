		<span style="font-size: 175%; line-height: normal;">Live Ticket Update XIII</span>
		<br><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">Bug Fixes</span>
		<br>1. Fixed a bug that was preventing any favorite tickets from showing the proper icon.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">New Features</span>
		<br>1. Ticket types are now in.  They are <span class="bug ticket_sprite ticket_button">bug tickets</span> and <span class="error ticket_sprite ticket_button">trouble tickets</span>.
		<br><blockquote>be sure to choose the proper type of ticket.  Bug reports should be fixed for web code and things that can be fixed, but probably not related to computers.  While trouble tickets are for everything that is not a bug.</blockquote>	
		<br>2. Recent tickets should now be working properly.
		<br>
		<br>
		<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">Known Issues</span>
		<br>1. Tickets is currently having issues in Opera, as well as versions of Firefox prior to 3.1.
		<br>2. Large Graphs are still not working properly
		<br>3. Some themes do not work 100%
