        <li>Fixed the button size issue, this was a result of some reset CSS code and me not taking into account this.</li>
        <li>Tickets was not working very well at all with some small screen devices (Smart Phones) and this has been mostly resolved. This is something that will forever be tweeked as new features get added and the layout improves</li>

        <li>When you log into tickets after first viewing a ticket it will now take you back to that ticket. Barring you do not close the window between.</li>

          <ol>
            <li>There was a small bug where if you clicked on the down arrow it would not fully trigger the dropdown effect.  This has been resolved.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The login process shoudld be much smoother now, and feel much more like you are never actually outside of tickets.</li>

        <li>Working on making tickets fit with the new website colors and feel. When the new website launches tickets should already feel right at home</li>
