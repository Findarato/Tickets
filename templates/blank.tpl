			<span style="font-size: 70%; line-height: normal;" id="version">v.2.12.15.r161</span>
			<br><span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">Bug Fixes</span>
			<br>1. Fixed a bug that was causing tickets to show the wrong replies.
			<br>2. Fixed many bugs relating to the theme generator.
			<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">New Features</span>
			<br>1. Tickets now uses localStorage.  If your browser supports it tickets that you have recently viewed will load up much faster. 
			<br>2. Bug reports are now separated out into their own section.  This will make it easier to file a bug report and see the progress associated with it.
			<br>2.1 Bug reports do not have a due date, nor do they have a department.  Bug reports will have a Priority level and a product.  They will look a lot like a ticket, but will be missing some of the components that are not needed in a bug report.
			<br>3. All of the notifications now have their own icon.  The icons are more descriptive of what the notification is actually telling you.
			<br>4. Along with the new notification icons comes new icons for tickets.  Tickets should look more like the website again.
			<br>
			<br>
			<span style="font-size: 150%; line-height: normal;">Known Issues</span>
			<br>1. Large Graphs are still not working properly
			<br>2. Some themes do not work 100%
			<br>3. There are no page numbers, nor any way to show more then the default amount of tickets in the list view.
			<br>4. Problem or bug icons do not show up in the ticket list.

			<br>2. Look and feak of tickets has changed.  No longer are the areas separated from their headers.  
			<br>3. CSS3 has attacked tickets.  There are now lots of cool new CSS3 tags running rampant around tickets.  If you see square corners and no drop shadows you are using an old browser.
			<br>4. there is now an [ img ] tag.  it allows for linking to offsite images within tickets.  No matter what size it is, it will work. 
			<br>
			<br>
